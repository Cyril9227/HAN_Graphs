# Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) applied to Graphs
The goal of this project is to apply the deep learning [HAN](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~diyiy/docs/naacl16.pdf) architecture to solve a multi-target graph regression problem. 

This project is part of the [Altegrad Data Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/altegrad-19) organized in the [Paris Saclay's Data Science Master 2](https://datascience-x-master-paris-saclay.fr/).

The data used to train this network can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/altegrad-19/data). 

More information on the project itself is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6xxvit8w6opk2gc/Altegrad_challenge_2019.pdf?dl=0).
